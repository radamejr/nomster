# Nomster

Nomster's goal is to create a Yelp style Web-Application. This app is completely user driven. It will allow you to add, rate and even comment on other visitors locations they have added. Have a favorite dive bar you want to let others know about? Add it! Using googles geo-locations for maps allows us to even pin point the exact address to visit.

## Getting Started

You can visit this application in the wild by clicking [here.](https://nomster-robert-adame.herokuapp.com/)
In order to add, comment or rate locations you will have to sign up for an account. Don't worry its simple and easy just click the signup button in the main navigation menu!
